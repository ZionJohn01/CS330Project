# CS330Project

Here are a few questions I'd like to answer about the overall design of the project:

How do I approach designing software?
When it comes to designing software, I like to have a very detailed image of what I want the result to look like. Then, after I've got that final image floating around up there in my head, I begin sketching out the layout of the actual code. Following an outline has helped me a lot during this course and allowed me to produce my final image as desired.

How do I approach developing programs?
There was a lot of work that I did outside of the code for this project. I made nearly all of the textures myself. I felt like it helped me to achieve the look I was going for. Inside of the code, there was a lot of iteration going on. Each week we would come back to the project and implement what concepts we had learned into the scene.
This helped to space it out rather than learn everything and then implement all at once. I was able to add little changes to that initial image that I felt would better reflect what we had learned in class.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I'm a very visual learner. I always have been. So, to have the ability to create a visual representation of what I've learned is incredibly helpful. If I learn a new concept, I can immediately begin programming it into a 3D scene with OpenGL.
This visual application of what I've learned is going to help me remember it. I'm looking forward to using this in my educational and professional career.
